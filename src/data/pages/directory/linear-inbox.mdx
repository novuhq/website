## Key Features

*   **Real-time In-App Notifications:** Implements a fully functional in-app inbox mirroring Linear's sleek UI/UX, built with **Shadcn UI** components.
*   **Multi-channel Delivery:** Designed to support various notification channels, including in-app, email, and push, ensuring users receive timely updates where they prefer.
*   **Flexible Data Modeling:** Outlines a robust data model that maps Linear's core entities (Issues, Teams, Users, Projects) to Novu's notification primitives (Subscribers, Topics), enabling highly contextual and targeted notifications.
*   **Actionable Notifications:** Emphasizes a structured payload design with clear `cta` (Call-to-Action) properties, allowing users to directly interact with notifications.
*   **Advanced Inbox Functionality:** Showcases features like:
    *   **Filtering and Sorting:** Organize notifications by read/unread status.
    *   **Bulk Actions:** Mark all as read or archive all notifications efficiently.
    *   **Context Menus:** Provides right-click options for marking as read/unread, archiving, and snoozing.
    *   **Snooze Functionality:** Allows users to temporarily hide notifications for later review.
*   **User Preference Management:** Includes a UI-only (ready for backend integration) system for users to customize their notification preferences by channel and event type.
*   **Scalable Architecture:** Leverages Novu's topics and subscribers to create a scalable and flexible notification backbone suitable for growing applications.
*   **Comprehensive Event Examples:** Provides detailed JSON structures for common Linear-like events (e.g., `issue.created`, `issue.assigned`, `issue.commented`), serving as a guide for triggering notifications.
*   **Modular and Maintainable Codebase:** Organized into clear components and utility functions, making it easy to understand, extend, and integrate into existing projects.

## How it Works

The system integrates Novu's `@novu/nextjs` and `@novu/js` SDKs to manage notification delivery. Key concepts include:

*   **Subscribers:** Each user in the task management tool maps to a Novu subscriber, allowing for personalized notification delivery and preference management.
*   **Topics:** Linear entities like Issues, Teams, and Projects are represented as Novu topics, enabling efficient broadcast of notifications to relevant groups of users (e.g., all followers of an issue, all members of a team).
*   **Triggers:** Events within the task management application (e.g., an issue being assigned, a comment being added) trigger Novu workflows, which then process and send notifications to the appropriate subscribers and channels based on their preferences.
*   **Payload Structure:** A standardized JSON payload ensures that all necessary contextual data is available for rendering rich, informative notifications across different channels (in-app, email, Slack, etc.).

This project serves as an ideal starting point for developers looking to implement a robust and user-friendly notification system that enhances engagement and keeps users informed within their applications.

<Tab title='Data Model'>

When building something like a task management tool like Linear, the data modeling is very crucial to understand and to outline what properties each entity has.

In this particular inbox example, we focused mainly on what should be used inside an in-app notification and what properties should be passed when triggering a notification to Novu. 

We also attempted to create a recommended structure of the payload schema that transactional event notifications in tools like Linear might require. 

## Mapping Linear Concepts to Novu's Notification Model

When implementing notifications with Novu, you can map these concepts directly to Novu's core primitives—**subscribers** and **topics**—to create a flexible and scalable notification system.

<Tab title='Issue'>


`Issues` – The core unit of work in Linear.

Each issue represents a task, bug, or feature request (e.g., `ENG-123`). This is where most activity happens—status updates, new comments, assignee changes—and is often the most granular level for sending notifications.

---

### Issues → Topics

**Issue ID** (`ENG-123`) → Topic: `issue-ENG-123`  
Used to notify all participants of an issue (assignee, followers)

**Subscribers** (Users following an issue) → Subscribers in the topic  
Auto-subscribe on comment, assignment, or manual follow

**Event** (`[event]`) → Trigger: `[event]`  
Sent to topic subscribers or to assigned user

#### Example: Comment Notification

Notify all participants when a comment is added or the status changes.

```jsx
await novu.trigger('new-comment', {
  to: [{ type: 'Topic', topicKey: 'issue-ENG-123' }],
  payload: {
    issueId: 'ENG-123',
    commentText: 'Just pushed a fix!',
    commenterName: 'Alice Chen',
    // Additional payload properties would go here
  },
  actor: {
    subscriberId: 'workspace_A2B2C3_user_123'
  }
});
```

#### Data Model

```json
//  Issue Model
{
  "id": "string",                     // UUID of the issue
  "identifier": "string",            // Human-readable identifier (e.g. "ENG-158")

  },
  "createdAt": "ISODate",
  "updatedAt": "ISODate",
  "modelName": "Issue"
}
```

</Tab>

<Tab title='Team'>

`Teams` – Functional groups within a workspace.

Teams like Engineering or Marketing own their own sets of issues and projects. They provide structure, permissions, and ownership boundaries.

**Teams can also serve as logical segments for topic-based notifications in Novu (e.g., notifying all Engineering team members).**

### Teams → Topics

**Team Name** → Topic: `team-engineering`  
Used to notify all members of a team (e.g., `Engineering` team becomes topic `team-engineering`)

**Team Members** → Subscribers in the topic  
Users in the team are automatically added as subscribers to the topic. Subscribe/unsubscribe users as teams change.

**Team ID** → Optional for topic naming  
Can be used for a more stable `topicKey`: `team_b18ckas91` instead of relying on team names that might change.

**Use Case**: Notify all team members when a new issue is created or a sprint cycle starts.

```jsx
await novu.trigger('team-cycle-started', {
  to: [{ type: 'Topic', topicKey: 'team-engineering' }],
  payload: { teamName: 'Engineering', cycleId: 'cycle-123' }
});
```

#### Data Model

}
```

</Tab>

<Tab title='Users'>

`Users` – The individuals collaborating inside a workspace.

Each user has a unique ID and role (e.g., Admin, Member). Users can take actions (comment, assign, update), belong to one or more teams, and have personalized notification preferences.
**In Novu, each user maps to a** `subscriber`, and their preferences can drive delivery rules (channel, timing, frequency).

### Users → Subscribers

In **Linear**, a *user* is anyone collaborating within a workspace, whether they're commenting on issues, updating statuses, or managing projects.

In **Novu**, these Linear users become *subscribers*: the recipients of notifications triggered by issue activity, status changes, assignments, etc.

Each subscriber in Novu must have a unique `subscriberId`. 

**The recommended approach is to derive this from your Linear user ID, ideally in a way that makes it easy to trace the source (e.g., using your workspace name or internal database prefix).**

A consistent `subscriberId` pattern like `workspace_A2B2C3_user_123` makes debugging, tracing notification flows, and supporting multi-tenant setups easier.

Mapping **Users to Subscribers** allows you to:

- **Send personalized notifications** (e.g., when someone is assigned to an issue)
- **Track delivery and read status** per user
- **Manage preferences** and delivery channels (e.g., in-app vs email)
- **Support multi-tenant applications**, where users exist in different workspaces

---

### Example `subscriberId` Formats

**`workspace_A2B2C3_user_123`** : Standard multi-tenant setup

**`user_123`** : For single-tenant or internal tools

---

Store additional workspace metadata (e.g., internal ID, role) inside the subscriber object as custom fields. This helps with targeting, debugging, and analytics later on.

---

**Subscriber creation options:**

- **Just-in-time**: Inline when triggering a notification (ideal for quick, low-friction setup)
- **Ahead of time**: Register and update subscribers in Novu using the API, especially useful for managing preferences and long-term subscriptions

}
```

</Tab>

<Tab title='Workspace'>

`Workspace` – The company-wide container in Linear.

It holds all teams, users, issues, and projects. While not always directly tied to individual notifications, the workspace context is essential for managing access, organization-wide preferences, and admin-level settings.
This allows multi-tenant apps to keep each workspace's data and logic separated cleanly.


```json
//  Workspace (Organization) Model
{
  "id": "string",
  "name": "string",
  "urlKey": "string",                // Unique workspace identifier for URLs
  "logoUrl": "string",
  "createdAt": "ISODate",
  "updatedAt": "ISODate",
  "archivedAt": "ISODate",
  "deletionRequestedAt": "ISODate",
  "userCount": "number",
  "userCountRestriction": "number",
  "allowedAuthServices": ["string"], // e.g. ["google", "github"]
  "gitBranchFormat": "string",
  "gitLinkbackMessagesEnabled": true,
  "gitPublicLinkbackMessagesEnabled": false,
  "periodUploadVolume": "number",

  "subscription": {
    "type": "string",                // e.g. "pro"
    "seats": "number",
    "canceledAt": "ISODate"
  },
  "roadmapEnabled": true,
  "projectUpdatesReminderFrequency": "string", // e.g. "weekly"
  "modelName": "Organization"
}
```

</Tab>

<Tab title='Projects'>

`Projects` – Groupings of issues around a common goal or feature.

Projects offer a higher-level view of progress and often span multiple teams. Notifications might be triggered by project updates (e.g., phase changes, new milestones) or used for digest summaries.

### Projects → Topics

**Project Name** → Topic: `project-website-redesign`  
Used to notify everyone involved in a project (e.g., `Website Redesign` project becomes topic `project-website-redesign`)

**Project Members** → Subscribers in the topic  
Assigned collaborators are added as subscribers to the topic. Manage via project membership sync.

**Project ID** → Optional for `topicKey`  
For stable topic identifiers: `project_3gk58mndz` instead of relying on project names that might change.

**Use Case**: Notify project collaborators when milestones are reached or tasks are completed.

#### Data Model

```json
//  Project Model
{
  "id": "string",
  "name": "string",
  "description": "string",
  "slugId": "string",                // Used in URL slugs

<Tab title='Payload Structure'>

When building transactional notifications, the payload structure determines how effectively your messages reach users across different channels. Based on Linear's notification patterns, this guide outlines the essential properties needed for robust, multi-channel notifications.

## Why Payload Structure Matters

Your notification payload serves multiple purposes:
- **Cross-channel delivery**: The same payload powers in-app notifications, emails, and third-party integrations like Slack
- **Template flexibility**: Well-structured data enables dynamic content rendering across different notification types
- **User experience**: Proper payload design ensures users receive contextual, actionable notifications

## Core Payload Properties

Every notification event should include these four essential properties:

- `event` - Event Identifier
**Purpose**: A stable, unique identifier used for grouping notification templates and routing logic.

**Best practices**:
- Use kebab-case naming (e.g., `issue-updated`, `user-mentioned`)
- Keep names descriptive but concise
- Maintain consistency across your application

- `recipientId` - Target Recipients
**Purpose**: Specifies who should receive the notification.

**Formats supported**:
- Individual user ID: `{ subscriberId: "user-123" }`
- Topic-based: `{ type: "Topic", topicKey: "issue-ENG-158" }`
- Multiple recipients: Array of recipient objects

- `data` - Notification Context
**Purpose**: Contains all the contextual information needed to render meaningful notifications across channels.

**Should include**:
- Primary entity details (ID, title, description)
- Actor information (who performed the action)
- Action metadata (what happened, when)
- Relevant relationships (team, project, etc.)

- `cta` - Call-to-Action
**Purpose**: Provides the deep-link action that users can take from the notification.

**Structure**:
```js
cta: {
  label: "View issue",        // User-facing action text
  url: "/path/to/resource"    // Deep-link to relevant page
}
```

## Complete Example

Here's a comprehensive example of an issue update notification:

```js
await novu.trigger("issue-updated", {
  to: [{ type: "Topic", topicKey: "issue-ENG-158" }],
  payload: {
    // Primary entity information
    id: "ef42a753-1234-5678-9abc-def123456789",
    identifier: "ENG-158",
    title: "Data inconsistency",
    
    // Action context
    action: "assigned",
    eventTime: "2025-02-14T06:25:02.806Z",
    
    // Actor details
    performedBy: {
      id: "09fff126-1234-5678-9abc-def123456789",
      name: "Jane Developer",
      avatar: "https://cdn.myapp.com/avatars/jane.jpg"
    },
    
    // Organizational context
    team: {
      key: "ENG",
      name: "Engineering",
      icon: "Gears",
      color: "#5e6ad2"
    },
    
    // Additional metadata
    priority: 3,
    
    // User action
    cta: {
      label: "View issue",
      url: "/demo/issue/ENG-158/data-inconsistency"
    }
  }
});
```

## Channel-Specific Considerations

### In-App Notifications
- Use `performedBy.avatar` for user profile images
- `team.color` and `team.icon` for visual branding
- `eventTime` for timestamp display

### Email Notifications
- `performedBy.name` for personalized messaging
- `title` and contextual data for email subject lines
- `cta.url` for clickable actions

### Slack/Teams Integration
- `team.name` for channel routing
- Rich context data for message formatting
- `cta.label` and `cta.url` for action buttons

## Common Patterns

### User Actions
```js
// For actions like comments, assignments, mentions
{
  action: "commented",
      performedBy: { id: "user-123", name: "Actor Name" },
    target: { id: "target-123", name: "Target Name" },
  eventTime: "2025-02-14T06:25:02.806Z"
}
```

### System Events
```js
// For automated events like deadlines, status changes
{
  action: "deadline_approaching",
  source: "system",
  triggerCondition: "due_in_24_hours",
  eventTime: "2025-02-14T06:25:02.806Z"
}
```

### Status Changes
```js
// For workflow updates, state transitions
{
  action: "status_changed",
  from: "in_progress",
  to: "completed",
      performedBy: { id: "user-123", name: "Actor Name" },
  eventTime: "2025-02-14T06:25:02.806Z"
}
```

This structured approach ensures your notifications are informative, actionable, and consistently delivered across all channels.

#### **Inbox.tsx** - Main Container
- **Purpose**: Primary container that integrates Novu's Inbox component
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Manages subscriber identification
  - Handles inbox refresh logic
  - Configures Novu appearance settings
  - Renders custom notification items
- **Key Features**:
  - Custom header integration
  - Refresh mechanism for real-time updates
  - Responsive layout management

```jsx

//Inbox.tsx
  "use client";

import { Inbox, InboxContent, Notification } from "@novu/nextjs";
import { getSubscriberId } from "@/lib/subscriberUtils";
import { InboxHeader } from "./inboxHeader";
import { NotificationItem } from "./notificationItem";
import { useState } from "react";

export default function CustomInbox() {
  const subscriberId = getSubscriberId();
  const [refreshKey, setRefreshKey] = useState(0);

  const renderNotification = (notification: Notification) => {
    return (
      <NotificationItem notification={notification} onRefresh={refreshInbox} />
    );
  };

  const inboxConfig = {
    applicationIdentifier:
      process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_NOVU_APPLICATION_IDENTIFIER || "",
    subscriberId: subscriberId,
    appearance: {
      elements: {
        inboxHeader: {
          display: "none",
        },
      },
    },
  };

  // Function to trigger re-render
  const refreshInbox = () => {
    setRefreshKey((prev) => prev + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col h-full">
      <InboxHeader onRefresh={refreshInbox} />

      <div className="flex-1 overflow-hidden">
        <Inbox {...inboxConfig} key={refreshKey}>
          <InboxContent renderNotification={renderNotification} />
        </Inbox>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### **inboxHeader.tsx** - Header Interface
- **Purpose**: Provides filtering, sorting, and bulk action capabilities
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Provide bulk action buttons (mark all read, archive all)
  - Filter notifications

  stateId?: string;
  stateLabel?: string;
  [key: string]: unknown;
}

// Component for rendering state icons based on Linear issue states
export const NotificationStateIcon = ({
  notification,
}: {
  notification: Notification;
}) => {
  const data = notification.data as NotificationData;
  const stateId = data?.stateId;
  const stateLabel = data?.stateLabel;

### Utility Components

#### **timeFormater.tsx** - Time Display
- **Purpose**: Formats timestamps for human-readable display

```jsx
export const NotificationTime = ({
  timestamp,
}: {
  timestamp: string | undefined;
}) => {
  if (!timestamp) return null;

  try {
    const now = new Date();
    const date = new Date(timestamp);

    if (isNaN(date.getTime())) {
      return null;
    }

    const diffInMs = now.getTime() - date.getTime();
    const diffInHours = diffInMs / (1000 * 60 * 60);
    const diffInDays = diffInHours / 24;
    const diffInWeeks = diffInDays / 7;

    if (diffInHours < 1) {
      const minutes = Math.floor(diffInMs / (1000 * 60));
      return (
        <span className="text-xs text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400">{`${Math.max(1, minutes)}m`}</span>
      );
    }

    if (diffInHours < 24) {
      return (
        <span className="text-xs text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400">{`${Math.floor(diffInHours)}h`}</span>
      );
    }

    if (diffInDays < 7) {
      return (
        <span className="text-xs text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400">{`${Math.floor(diffInDays)}d`}</span>
      );
    }

    if (diffInWeeks < 4) {
      return (
        <span className="text-xs text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400">{`${Math.floor(diffInWeeks)}w`}</span>
      );
    }

    return (
      <span className="text-xs text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400">
        {date.toLocaleDateString("en-US", { month: "short", day: "numeric" })}
      </span>
    );
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error formatting timestamp:", error);

### User Preferences

The preferences system provides a UI-only implementation for notification preferences. This system demonstrates the complete interface structure and user experience flow, but currently operates with mock data and requires backend integration for full functionality.

#### Core Components

- DemoModal.tsx - Interactive preference demonstration interface
- PreferencesLayout.tsx - Consistent layout wrapper and styling
- updatePreferences.ts - Mock preference update logic (placeholder for API calls)
- Notification Components - Individual preference controls with stateless UI

#### Available Features (UI Only)

The interface includes comprehensive preference controls for:

- Channel preferences - Email, in-app, and push notification toggles
- Workflow-specific settings - Granular control over different notification types
- Time-based preferences - Schedule and frequency management
- Bulk operations - Mass preference updates and management

#### Integration Requirements

To activate full functionality, implement these backend components:

1. Data Layer

- User preference storage and retrieval system
- Real-time preference synchronization
- User authentication and authorization

2. API Integration

- RESTful endpoints for preference CRUD operations
- Integration with Novu's preference management API
- Error handling and validation

3. State Management

- Live preference updates across sessions
- Optimistic UI updates with rollback capability
- Cross-device preference synchronization
