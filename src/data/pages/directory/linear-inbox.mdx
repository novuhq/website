Tools like **Linear** serve as central hubs for team collaboration and project tracking. 

While staying updated on tasks, discussions, and progress is crucial, the firehose of notifications can quickly become overwhelming, leading to:

- Information overload and missed critical updates
- Constant distraction from important work
- Difficulty distinguishing signal from noise

A naive notification system might blast updates too broadly or lack the necessary granularity. 

**The ideal system should ensure users get the co*rrect* information about their work, at the *right* time, without the noise.**



## Linear Inbox Template

A customizable Novu inbox component designed for Linear-like project management applications with categorized notifications for issues, teams, projects, and comments.

<Tab title='Implementation'>

#### 1. Install the Novu In-App SDK

```bash
npm install @novu/nextjs
```

#### 2. Set Your API Credentials

Add your Novu application identifier to your `.env` file. The subscriber ID should be dynamically fetched from your authentication system:

```env
NOVU_APPLICATION_IDENTIFIER=your_app_id
```

**Note**: The `subscriberId` should be dynamically retrieved from your authentication system to ensure consistency across your application's databases and services.

#### 3. Configure the main Inbox Component

```javascript
import { Inbox, InboxContent } from '@novu/nextjs';

export function NovuInbox() {
  const subscriberId = getCurrentUserId();
  const applicationIdentifier = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_NOVU_APPLICATION_IDENTIFIER;
  
  if (!applicationIdentifier || !subscriberId) {
    return <div>Notifications not configured</div>;
  }

  const tabs = [
    { label: 'All', filter: {} },
    { label: 'Issues', filter: { tags: ['Issues'] } },
    { label: 'Comments', filter: { tags: ['Comments'] } },
    { label: 'Teams', filter: { tags: ['Teams'] } },
    { label: 'Projects', filter: { tags: ['Projects'] } },
  ];

  return (
    <Inbox applicationIdentifier={applicationIdentifier} subscriberId={subscriberId}>
      <InboxContent />
    </Inbox>
  );
}
```

</Tab>
