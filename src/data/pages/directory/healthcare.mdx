<Tab title='Overview'>

The Healthcare application, inspired by the "One Health" concept, provides a centralized platform for patients, doctors, and administrators to manage healthcare interactions efficiently. 
Its robust notification system, powered by Novu, ensures timely and relevant communication across all user groups.

## Key Features

- **Real-time In-App Notifications:** Implements a fully functional in-app inbox, ensuring users receive immediate updates within the platform, built with Shadcn UI components.
- **Multi-channel Delivery:** Designed to support various notification channels, including in-app, email, and SMS/push notifications, ensuring users receive critical health-related updates via their preferred method.
- **Flexible Data Modeling:** Utilizes a robust data model that maps healthcare entities (Patients, Doctors, Appointments, Departments, Healthcare Providers) to Novu's notification primitives (Subscribers, Topics), enabling highly contextual and targeted notifications.
- **Advanced Inbox Functionality:** Showcases features like:
	- **Filtering and Categorization:** Organize notifications by type (e.g., Messages, Appointments, Medications, Billing).
	- **Read/Unread Status:** Clearly distinguish new notifications.
	- **Customizable Inbox Appearance:** Tailored UI elements for a seamless user experience.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Leverages Novu's topics and subscribers to create a scalable and flexible notification backbone suitable for growing healthcare platforms and varying organizational structures.
- **Comprehensive Event Examples:** Provides detailed JSON structures for common healthcare events (e.g., appointment.booked, patient.testResultsReady, doctor.patientMessage), serving as a guide for triggering notifications.
- **Modular and Maintainable Codebase:** Organized into clear components and utility functions, making it easy to understand, extend, and integrate into existing projects.

</Tab>

<Tab title='Data Model'>

The primary entity for the data modeling in this platform would be a `user`.

Each user represents an individual who interacts with the healthcare platform, whether they're providing care, receiving treatment, or managing administrative tasks. Users can perform various actions like scheduling appointments, sending messages, or updating medical records.

In Novu, each user maps to a `subscriber`, and their preferences can drive delivery rules (channel, timing, frequency).

---

## **Subscriber**

A **Subscriber** is an **individual entity** — usually representing a **single user** — that you send notifications to **directly**.

Use a **Subscriber** when:

- The notification is **personalized** to a single user (e.g., a specific doctor, patient, or admin).
- The user has **individual settings** or **preferences** for receiving notifications.
- You need to **track or audit** notifications at the **user level**.
- The user’s relationship to the event is **permanent or uniquely scoped** (e.g., a patient’s own appointment reminder).

**Examples of Subscriber usage:**

- Sending a platform update to a specific doctor (`user_123`).
- Notifying a patient that their test results are ready (`patient_user_123`).
- Alerting a healthcare admin about an expiring staff license (`healthProvider_123_admin_userId`).

---

## **Topic**

A **Topic** is a **dynamic grouping** — it represents a **collection of subscribers** based on shared attributes, relationships, or membership.

Use a **Topic** when:

- The notification should be sent to **multiple users at once**.
- The group **membership can change dynamically** (users can join/leave the group).
- You want to **decouple notification targeting** from individual user IDs.
- The event is **relevant to a role, group, department, or interaction**, rather than just one user.

**Examples of Topic usage:**

- Sending a policy update to all staff members of a healthcare provider (`healthProvider_123_staff`).
- Notifying all cardiology department doctors about new imaging protocols (`healthProvider_123_cardiology`).
- Reminding all participants linked to an appointment thread (`healthProvider_123_cardiology_a1b2_user_123`).

</Tab>

</Tabs>

</Tab>

<Tab title='Payload Structure'>

A well-defined notification payload serves several key purposes:

- Cross-channel Delivery: Enables the same payload to power notifications for in-app display, email, SMS, and even third-party integrations like secure messaging platforms or hospital information systems.
- Template Flexibility: Ensures that templates for various notification channels can dynamically render rich and meaningful content.
- User Experience: Guarantees that users receive contextual, actionable notifications that allow them to quickly understand and respond to healthcare events.

#### `name` - Workflow Name / Identifier (required)

Usually corresponds to the event that is being triggered. It is a stable, unique identifier used for grouping notification templates and routing logic.

```json
"name": "workflow_identifier"
```

**Best practices**:
- Use kebab-case naming (e.g., `issue-updated`, `user-mentioned`)
- Keep names descriptive but concise
- Maintain consistency across your application

---

#### `to` - Target Recipients

Specifies who should receive the notification.

**Formats supported**:
- Individual user ID: `{ subscriberId: "user-123" }`
- Topic-based: `{ type: "Topic", topicKey: "issue-ENG-158" }`
- Multiple recipients: Array of recipient objects

---

#### `payload` - Notification Context (required)

Contains all the contextual information needed to render meaningful notifications across channels.

**Could include**:
- Primary entity details (ID, title, description)
- Actor information (who performed the action)
- Action metadata (what happened, when)
- Relevant relationships (team, project, etc.)
- Call-to-Action (CTA)

**Structure**:

```json
"payload": {
  "id": "appt_67890",
  "type": "Annual Checkup",
  "dateTime": "2025-08-01T10:00:00Z",
  "location": "Main Clinic, Room 301",
  "doctor": {
    "id": "doctor_user_456",
    "name": "Dr. Emily White",
    "specialty": "General Practice",
  },
  "patient": {
    "id": "patient_user_123",
    "name": "Alice Smith",
  },
  "cta": {
    "label": "View appointment",
    "url": "/app/appointments/appt_67890"
  }
}
```

### Complete Example

Here's a comprehensive example of an appointment.reminder notification, demonstrating the ideal payload structure:

```javascript

	await novu.trigger("appointment-reminder", {
  to: [{ 
    type: "Topic",
    topicKey: "appointment-appt_67890" 
  }], 
  payload: {
    id: "appt_67890",
    type: "Annual Checkup",
    dateTime: "2025-08-01T10:00:00Z",
    location: "Main Clinic, Room 301",
    action: "reminder",
    eventTime: "2025-07-30T10:00:00Z", 
    patient: {
      id: "patient_user_123",
      name: "Alice Smith",
    },
    doctor: {
      id: "doctor_user_456",
      name: "Dr. Emily White",
      specialty: "General Practice",
    },
    department: {
      id: "healthProvider_123_general_med",
      name: "General Medicine",
    },
    reminderTime: "2 days before",
    status: "scheduled",
    cta: {
      label: "Confirm Appointment",
      url: "/app/appointments/appt_67890/confirm",
    },
  },
});
```

### Channel-Specific Considerations

**In-App Notifications**

- Leverage `patient.name`, `doctor.name`, `department.name` for personalized display.
- Use `dateTime` and `eventTime` for clear temporal context.
- Utilize `cta.url` for seamless navigation within the app.

**Email Notifications**

- `title`, `type`, and contextual data (e.g., `doctor.name`, `location`) for informative subject lines and email body.
- `cta.url` for prominent clickable actions in the email.

**SMS Notifications**

- Focus on critical information due to character limits (e.g., `type`, `dateTime`, `location`, `cta.url`).
- Prioritize `cta.url` for quick access to app features.

**Push Notifications**

- Concise title and body (e.g., 'Reminder: Your Annual Checkup is Tomorrow at 10 AM').
- `cta.url` to directly open the relevant section of the app.

  "@novu/api": "^1.4.0",
  "@novu/js": "^3.7.0",
  "@novu/nextjs": "^3.7.0"
}
```

### **NovuInbox** 

`/app/notifications/components/NovuInbox.tsx`

**Purpose**: Renders the main notification inbox interface.

```javascript
'use client';
