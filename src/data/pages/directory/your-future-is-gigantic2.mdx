print("Your program takes:", timetaken)  # Example 0.00001
`,
    },
    {
      language: 'php',
      code: `
<?php
$color = "red";

echo "My car is " . $color . "<br>";

echo "My boat is " . $coLOR . "<br>";
?>

`,
}

### Customizing the Inbox Experience

The Inbox with Images template provides a flexible foundation for displaying media-rich notifications. By customizing its appearance, behavior, and functionality, you can tailor the inbox to match your application’s branding and user needs. This section explores styling the inbox, handling user interactions, and ensuring a responsive design for all devices.

#### Styling the Inbox Component

You can fully style the inbox to match your app’s visual identity:

- **Colors & Fonts**
  <br />
  Customize text, background, and border colors using your brand palette. Use consistent font styles
  to match the rest of your UI.
- **Image Thumbnails**
  <br />
  Adjust thumbnail sizes, aspect ratios, and placement (e.g., left-aligned, above text, or
  full-width banners).
- **Spacing & Layout**
  <br />
  Control padding, margin, and item spacing for a clean and readable layout.
- **Custom CSS or Tailwind Classes**
  <br />
  If you're using a framework like React or Vue, you can override styles with custom classes or
  scoped CSS.

  ]}
/>

#### Handling User Interactions

Make the inbox interactive and intuitive:

- **Clickable Items**
  <br />
  Each notification can have a click handler that navigates users to relevant content (e.g., a product page or update detail).
- **Action Buttons**
  <br />
  Add custom buttons (like "View", "Dismiss", or "Reply") with specific functionality per notification.
- **Read/Unread States**
  <br />
  Visually differentiate read vs unread notifications. Use indicators (like bold text, a dot, or background color) to improve clarity.
- **Hover & Focus States**
  <br />
   Improve accessibility and usability by providing visual feedback when users hover or tab through notifications.

2. Animation and Transitions
3. Empty States
   1. Design what the inbox looks like when there are no notifications (e.g., an illustration with a message like “You’re all caught up!”).
