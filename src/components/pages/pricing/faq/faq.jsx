    question: 'What is an event?',
    answer:
      'An event is a request (for instance, an API call to /v1/events/trigger) that starts off an action in the Novu Workflow Engine. Events can make many different types of actions, including digests, delays, and sending notifications to various channels, as well filters and user preference checks. Event count per notification sent differs based on the complexity of your notification workflows.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is a notification?',
    answer:
      'A notification is any message sent over any channel, after Novu logic engine, Novu user preferences, and your configuration calculated and crafted the message. A notification can be sent to an email, in-app Inbox, chat, push, and more.',

        to more easily run it in your local environment. Novu Cloud is based on the Novu Project,
        and is a managed service that we deploy, and manage as a service. It is the most scalable
        and robust way to enable industry-leading notifications in your apps and website. Novu Cloud
        includes SLAs, and additional business-level features that are not available in the open
        source Novu Project.

    question: 'How many notifications can I send on Novu Cloud?',
    answer:
      "Virtually any number you need to. In fact, sending is more often limited by your configured providers than Novu Cloud. In general, you won't have to worry about it.",

    question: 'In what regions is Novu Cloud hosted?',
    answer: 'Novu Cloud instances are deployed in the US (East coast), and the EU (Germany).',

        Yes. Enterprise plans are available for businesses that require extended enterprise-grade
        features, and specific SLAs or have unique concerns about PII, security, insurance, or

    question: 'Can I use Novu free of charge?',
    answer:
      'Yes, you can. If you send less than 30K events per month, then Novu Cloud is entirely free. Another option is to deploy the Open-Source version of Novu onto your own infrastructure, but that does not give you the unique SLA and global redundancy we have in the Cloud version of Novu.',
